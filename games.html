    <h2>Sweepstakes</h2>
    <p>Sweepstakes are fun ‘lottery style’ games where each participant goes into an    open draw and gets randomly drawn a team (or horse!) who can win them a prize. No   prior knowledge of the sport is required – or even helpful! Sweepstakes offered include the Grand National Sweepstake in horse racing and the FIFA World Cup final tournaments in football.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>Entry is easy, the organiser chooses the competition, the entry fee and sets the pot prize money distribution breakdown e.g. winner takes all etc. Once you have entered the competition and all players are in the draw will be done. Then it’s time to research your team, or horse, and hope they do the business and win you a prize plus some bragging rights!

    <h2>Last Man Standing</h2>
    <p>Last Man Standing is a league-based competition whereby each player must select a different team in each game week of the league to win in the hope of progressing to the next round/game week. Those participants with winning selections will stay in the competition the next week while others will be knocked out. Your challenge is to be the last person standing and collect the prize money! Competitions offered include the Premier League in England and the League of Ireland.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>The organiser will choose the league, entry fee and start week for the competition. Once entered, players must choose one team each week and that team must win for them to progress. You cannot choose the same team more than once. In Last Man Standing, the key is knowing when to use your big teams and when to keep them for another day!

                    •	If all remaining players lose, they all go through to the next round. If some of the remaining players draw and others lose, only the teams that drew progress. If all remaining players draw, they all progress to the next round.

    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>The organiser selects the competition and how the prize money will be distributed. Participants can then join by following the link or code given to them by the organisers. The tournament fixtures/festival schedule will be available to all participants upon entry, where they can select their predicted outcome for each match/race. Some research here might help to give you the edge!
