Description
The project is based on a company specialising in 'friendly betting' games, that is; games where users play varirous
games against each other for money. This type of game is also known as pooled betting' as it is more similar to a lottery
format than traditional betting/gambling, which in reality is against highly qualified risk analysts and probably experts.
This project is purely to give users an understanding of the games available, how they can play them, what the rules are
and what sports are covered. Users/fans can navigate by game type or sport.
The pages in the project are:
index.html
gametypes.html
sports.html

UX
The brand colours of Friendly Bet are blue and orange, with a hint of white. The reason for the colour choice is 
that blue denotes trust (important for a site offering social betting games for the first time) and orange 
represents fun. Significantly from a design and UX perspective, blue and orange are complementary pairs on the 
color wheel. The branding colour combination is maintained in the logo and navbar of the header, as well as the 
footer via the branded blue background, white h5 headings and branded orange h4 headings. Users are never far
from branded navigation.

User Stories
As an external user, I have the following goals:
*	Find out about the website
*	Find out about the games
*	Determine whether the games will be fun / enjoyable
*	Find out how the game works
*	Understand the rules
As a site owner, I have the following goals:
*	Generate user interest in playing the games
*	Allow users to easily understand the games and why they are fun
*	Make them likely to tell their friends about the games and share them
*	Users associate upcoming sporting events with the games themselves e.g. Premier League, Masters Golf, Grand National etc


Features
The navbar uses a responsive collapseable Javascript plug-in. This allows users to toggle between the navigation
options, while keeping the brand logo at the top of the viewport at all times.

In the gametypes.html file, users are given a brief introdution to each game, details of how a game is played
and a more definitive set of rules for those looking for a deeper understanding. The rules can be accessed from 
a modal - this is the 'less fun', more serious content is not taking up large sections of a page that predominantly
aims to focus on the fun aspects of the games. The button type used from the Bootstrap framework is the button
'info' class which reprents what the users are accessing. The secondary button is used for closing.

Within sports.html, external links to sport fixtures and schedules are displayed in the traditional link format
to give clarity to users that they are leaving the site. 'target=_blank' is used to ensure users can easily 
navigate back to the Friendly Bet site.

Issues and Bugs


Scalability
The project represents huge opportunities for scalability and future iterations. Live games could be added, 
based on the documented formats, which utilise JavaScript to bring the games alive for the user, add backend 
funtionality and databases to manage and store all customer data. 



Technologies
Copy and pasted jquery, popper and bootstrap cdn js plug-ins to head from w3schools.com.
